# Take-Home Task

Welcome! This take-home task is designed to help us understand **how you think**, **where you choose to improve**, and **how you balance UX, architecture, and communication**. We’re not just evaluating code — we’re interested in your **judgment**, especially in the context of our mission.

## What You'll Be Working On

We've used an AI tool (in this case Bolt.new) to generate a **very basic prototype** of a customizable dashboard:

- Users can **drag and resize charts** on the dashboard (using `react-grid-layout`).
- Each chart is built with **Highcharts**.
- Each chart has an “Ask AI” button that opens a text input.
- When the user enters a question, the system simulates an LLM-generated chart by replacing the original chart with a mocked Highcharts config.

This prototype **works**, but it’s minimal. It was entirely generated by an AI and is intentionally raw.

## The Mission

At **Intropy**, we help traditional industries access their scattered data through a simple and powerful interface — **data at their fingertips**.

Many of our customers:
- Are **not tech-savvy**.
- Have **never interacted with AI tools**.
- Need **simple, intuitive interfaces** that build **trust** in data.

This exercise simulates the kind of challenges we face: turning messy or disconnected ideas into helpful, actionable interfaces for real world impact.

## Your Task

You can start from the existing code or rebuild however you like — up to you. Your goal is to **elevate this prototype** and make **choices that reflect what matters** for the end users.

### Core Objectives

You don't need to do everything — we want to see **where you choose to invest effort**.

Here are some directions you might explore:

- **UX & UI polish**
  - Make the interface easier or more intuitive for a first-time user.
  - Improve styling, layout, or accessibility.
  - Add helpful tooltips, empty states, loading indicators, etc.

- **Engineering quality**
  - Introduce better state management, component abstraction, or type safety.
  - Improve the architecture to make future chart types or layouts easier to extend.

- **Customization and persistence**
  - Allow users to save/load their dashboard layouts.
  - Allow editing chart titles or options.
 
- Don’t feel limited to just graph outputs. We’re also very interested in how you might present **report-style summaries or suggested actions**, especially if they help non-technical users understand what to do next.
  
## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Submission Instructions

- Fork this repo and work in your own copy.
- When you're done, invite both `ykteh93` and `stephanschielke` as collaborators to your repo so we can review your work.
- Write a short `DECISIONS.md` or include a section in the `README.md`:
  - What did you choose to focus on, and why?
  - What would you do next if you had more time?
  - Anything you'd like us to know while reviewing your work.

## Thanks!

We know take-home tasks take time, and we appreciate your effort. We’re excited to see your take on the challenge and how you'd help bring clarity to complex data for real-world users.

If you have any questions or want to clarify anything, feel free to reach out.
